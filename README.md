Dotfiles for a Linux Rice. Made using i3, URxvt, Polybar and Rofi.

## What is this? 

Void Rice is my fist Linux Rice. It's called "Void Rice" because it was made for my Void Linux
computer, which I generally use to take notes at school and simple activities.

I am planning to use it on my main computer when I'll install Linux on it.
